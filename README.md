# AntarticBot
AntarticBot was a bot I coded for my discord server back in the day. I used the discord.py library and I am very proud with how it came out. It had it's flaws and still does tbh, but overall it was a good learning experience. To this day I'd call this a work in progress still, but to be honest I'm probably never going to touch this again since discord.py is really outdated. In that matter this is a finished project.
