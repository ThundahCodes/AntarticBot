# AntarticBot
ðŸ¤– Discord Bot with Ticket System and Moderation Commands

This Python-powered Discord bot is designed to assist server administrators with a built-in ticket system and various moderation commands. The bot is equipped with functionalities to manage warnings, kicks, bans, mute/unmute, and more, providing essential tools for maintaining a well-moderated community. It was designed for my own server which is no longer running so you can consider the project as finished.

Features:

Ticket System: Users can create support tickets using reactions, which will create dedicated text channels for communication.
Moderation Commands: Kick, ban, mute, unmute, and issue warnings to members based on their behavior.
Customizable Prefix: Administrators can easily configure the bot's command prefix for server-specific settings.
Magic 8-Ball: A fun feature where the bot answers your yes/no questions like a magic 8-ball.
Various Fun Commands: Includes commands for hugging and slapping other members.
How to Use:

Invite the bot to your Discord server with the necessary permissions.
Set up a 'prefixes.json' file to configure the bot's command prefix for your server.
Ensure that 'ticket_configs.txt' and other required files are present for ticket system and moderation settings.
Start the bot and it will be ready to respond to commands and manage the ticket system.
